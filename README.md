# ReactHunterReturns
A project to bring back the OG React Hunter https://github.com/Lenshang/ReactHunter.

# Building ReactHunter
You need NPM. NPM for your system can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/download/. To check if it is correctly installed on Windows you can open Command Prompt and type: "node -v" and hit Enter, if a series of numbers come up you are ready for the next step.

Once NPM is installed, open the project in Visual Studio 2019. The project file is located at ReactHunter.sln. Simply hit "Run" in the top toolbar and wait for VS to finishing building the project.

# TODO
1. Check that it actually works for the latest version of MHW
2. Make it look nice
